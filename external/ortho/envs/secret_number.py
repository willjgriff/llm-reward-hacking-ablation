"""
The secret_number environment of ~/wgmn/agent-interp-envs as an Inspect task: the game container as a docker sandbox (envs/docker/secret_number),
the config's task settings and prompts (envs/configs/secret_number), the two tools with the schemas of tools.py, and the harness's loop from
run_step.py and tool_calling.py: one tool call per turn; a turn with no call, several calls, an unknown function, unparseable arguments or a
banned command is reverted and resampled, up to 25 attempts, before the harness's error message goes into the transcript; a command runs through
sh in /agent with the game variables and 30 s timeout; after it the guess log and guess script are checked for tampering. Each turn's executed
commands and tamper flags go to the sample store as one step record, and the scorer applies the cheat rules of secret_number_flags.py to them.
The task takes an EvalCfg (common.py) and runs through run.py: its config, n (games) and seed.

Differences from the container harness: the model is called from outside the container and the container has no network; /opt is empty once a
sample is set up (the game's guess script is moved to /agent and the other variant deleted); a call with unparseable arguments is reverted like the other rejected calls (the harness also tried an escape fix after ten
failures). The secret is drawn from `seed`, one draw per sample.
